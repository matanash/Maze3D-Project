!MESSAGE The 'org.eclipse.ui.startup' extension from 'com.objectaid.uml' does not provide a 'class' attribute.
This usage is deprecated and a 'class' attribute should be provided.
The release after Mars (4.5) will no longer support the deprecated usage!

!MESSAGE Warning: The environment variable HOME is not set. The following directory will be used to store the Git
user global configuration and to define the default location to store repositories: 'C:\Users\MatanA'. If this is
not correct please set the HOME environment variable and restart Eclipse. Otherwise Git for Windows and
EGit might behave differently since they see different configuration options.
This warning can be switched off on the Team > Git > Confirmations and Warnings preference page.
